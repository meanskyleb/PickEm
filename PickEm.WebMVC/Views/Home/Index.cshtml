            Pick 'Em is an ASP.NET Application and its sole purpose to be able to create a player, create a game from a pre-seeded list of teams,
            in this case the NFL, and then pick the winner.

        <p>This is V1.0 and is very basic, but the goal is there and gives a stepping stone to build off of for future development. Eventually, the need to add
        pre-determined schedules along with records for both each team and each player. Also, being able to predict the score for each game incase of tie breakers and adding
        the ability for the winner for each week to win money. So adding Venmo or PayPal would be a nice addition to the entire application. </p>

        <p>Eventually the goal will to have a mass amount of sport entusiasts to compete with their friends in a friendly manner with sports that they love and potentially win money in the process.
        It will work like a bank account on the application and the winner each week will receive a certain amount of money depending on the group's decision. Also, agreements from the NFL and each 
        team will be necessary and if any sports are added will also be necessary as well. </p>
